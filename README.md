Time series analysis in ”pasajebc.dat” dataset which is about the passengers in the
port of Barcelona from 1997 to 2020.**

1. Identification:
a) Determine the needed transformations to make the series stationary. Justify the transformations
carried out using graphical and numerical results.
b) Analyze the ACF and PACF of the stationary series to identify at least two plausible models. Reason
about what features of the correlograms you use to identify these models.
2. Estimation:
a) Use R to estimate the identified models.
3. Validation:
a) Perform the complete analysis of residuals, justifying all assumptions made. Use the corresponding
tests and graphical results.
b) Include analysis of the expressions of the AR and MA infinite models, discuss if they are causal
and/or invertible and report some adequacy measures.
c) Check the stability of the proposed models and evaluate their capability of prediction, reserving
the last 12 observations.
d) ) Select the best model for forecasting.
4. Predictions:
a) Obtain long term forecasts for the twelve months following the last observation available; provide
also confidence intervals.
